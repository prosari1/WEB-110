  <h1>M6 - Site Planning Analysis Page</h1>
  <h2 class="title-project">Brazilian Cuisine</h2>
  <h2>Website Goal:</h2>
    <p>The goal of my website Brazilian Cuisine is to provide information about the most popular brazilian food. Often in other countries the culture is miss interpreted and poorly taught. So, with the objective of showing and sharing simple and common food dishes, I intend to gather information and recipes with photos to display in a neat and simple way.</p>
  <h2>Working Title:</h2>
    <p>These are the working titles that will be used in the project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Home</li>
      <li>Recipes (dropdown menu)
        <ul>
          <li>Cheese Bread</li>
          <li>Chocolate Truffels</li>
          <li>Black Beans Stew</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Peculiarities</li>
      <li>About</li>
      <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Home page is going to have links to the Recipe page. In the Recipe pages will display couple of brazilian recipes, very simple and clean layout. It should have a table with ingredients and instructions. The Peculiarities page will display some local ingredients peculiar from Brazil. About page will inform more about the purpose of the website. The Contact page will have a form so the user can fill it up and get in touch with the website owner.</p>
  <h2>Forms:</h2>
    <p>One entire page will be dedicated to Contact us page through email. A simple form will be used for this purpose.</p>
  <h2>Sources:</h2>
    <p>The most critical part will be to gather authentic recipes per region and good photos. The advantage for me is that I can search in local websites then translate to English.</p>
