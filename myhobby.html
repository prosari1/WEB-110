  <h1>My Hobby - Fishing</h1>
  <h2>The reason I love fishing</h2>
  <time datetime="2020-03-20"> March 20, 2020</time>
    <p>Growing up, my dad always used to take my brother and I to a lake close by our house, so we could fish together. Usually this was my after school actitivty for many many years. I learned how to be more patient and strategic about techniques to make the fish eat my bait.</p>
    <p>For me it is a method to relax and appreciate the nature. Also, my dad taught me that we should never kill a fish unless is for feeding someone. That's why I like to catch and release.</p>

<h2>Favorite Fish: Pirarara</h2>
<p>My favorite kind of fish is a Brazilian species called Pirarara also known as Red Tail Catfish. Something interesting, this fish feeds heavily on live and dead fishes and other meat. It's a kind of fish that cleans the river.</p>
